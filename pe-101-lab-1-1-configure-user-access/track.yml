title: 'PE101 Lab 1.1: Configure User Access'
teaser: Learn how to assign role-based access in Puppet Enterprise.
description: |-
  ## Introduction

  In this lab, you'll learn how to manage users and roles in Puppet Enterprise (PE) so that you can control what tasks users can do within PE. Assigning users to roles — or role-based access control (RBAC) — is more efficient than managing permissions for individual users.

  ## Prerequisites

  None

  ## Technical recommendations

  For the best lab experience, use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari are not suitable for this lab — if you must use one of these browsers, see the [Lab Help Guide](https://puppet-kmo.gitbook.io/practice-lab-help/) for workarounds.

  ## Keep an eye on the clock

  ![15 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/15min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 30 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 15 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  When you're ready to begin, click **Start track**. When you've completed the lab, click **Stop** (appears at the top of this page after the lab starts).
