    Configuring Code Manager to move code from source control to the primary server
     makes it easier for developers to safely and securely deliver their code.

    After developers' code changes are reviewed, approved, and merged, Code Manager authenticates the dedicated Code Deployer user role to automatically push the code to the primary server. Assigning a dedicated user to be a Code Deployer limits access to the primary server, which is considered a best practice.

    The code is then available to test in a separate Puppet environment, such as a branch for a specific feature, a staging environment, or a simulated production environment.

    In this lab, you will:
    - Create a dedicated Code Deployment user that you will use to authenticate code deployment.
    - Configure Code Manager to authenticate and download your control repo from the Git server.
    - In your control repo, create a feature branch from the main branch, enabling you to develop safely without affecting production.
    - Add a module to the Puppetfile in your feature branch to test a code deployment.
    - Deploy code from your feature branch to the primary server, enabling you to test changes on nodes in a separate Puppet environment.

    Click **Start** when you're ready to begin.

Clone the control repo on your Windows development workstation
============
1. On the **Windows Agent** tab, from the **Start** menu, open **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Enable autosave so that you don't have to remember to save your changes. Click **File** > **Auto Save**.
3. Open the `C:\CODE` directory. Click **File** > **Open Folder**, navigate to the `C:\CODE` directory, and click **Select Folder**.

    ‚úèÔ∏è **Note:**  If prompted, click **Accept** to trust code in this directory.<br><br>

4. In VS Code, open a terminal. Click **Terminal** > **New Terminal**.
5. In the VS Code terminal window, run the following command:

        git clone git@gitea:puppet/control-repo.git

Add the apache module to the Puppetfile
============
1. Check out the `webapp` feature branch:
    ```
    cd control-repo
    git checkout webapp
    ```
2. Open the **Puppetfile** at the root of the **control-repo** directory. Add the apache module by copying the code below into the end of the Puppetfile:
    ```
    mod 'puppetlabs-apache',
      :git => 'http://gitea:3000/puppet/apache.git',
      :ref => 'main'
    ```
3. Commit and push your changes to the `webapp` feature branch:
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add Apache module dependency"
    git push
    ```


Create a dedicated code deployment user
============
üîÄ Switch to the **PE Console** tab.

1. Log in with username `admin` and password `puppetlabs`.
2. In the left navigation panel, under the **Admin** heading, click **Access Control**.
3. On the **Users** tab, enter the following information, and then click **Add local user**:
     - In the **Full name** field, enter `Code Deployer`.
     - In the **Login** field, enter `deployer`.
4. Click the **Code Deployer** user, and then click the **Generate password reset** link in the upper-right corner.
5. Copy the generated link, open a new tab in your local browser (outside of the lab environment) and paste the link. In the **NEW PASSWORD** field, enter the password `puppetlabs`, and then click **Reset password**.
6. Close the browser tab. On the **PE Console** tab, close the **Password Reset Link** window.
7. Navigate to **Access Control** > **User roles** tab, and then click the **Code Deployers** role.
8. From the **User name** list, select **Code Deployer** and click **Add User**; then, commit the changes (click **Commit** in the bottom-right corner).

Configure Code Manager
============
1. Navigate to the **Node Groups** page, expand the **PE Infrastructure** group, and then click **PE Master**.
2. On the **Classes** tab, scroll to **Class: puppet_enterprise::profile::master**. From the **Parameter name** list, select the parameter shown, enter the relevant value, and then click **Add to node group**. Repeat for each parameter shown:

      |  Parameter                     |  Value                                                 |
      |--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
      |  code_manager_auto_configure   |  true                                                  |
      |  r10k_remote                   | "git@gitea:puppet/control-repo.git"                    |
      |  r10k_private_key              | "/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ssh/id-control_repo.rsa" |

    üí° **Note:** Be sure to enter the value `true` without quote marks because it's a Boolean value, not a string.

3. Commit the changes.

    üîÄ Switch to the **Primary Server** tab.<br><br>

4. Run `puppet agent -t` to apply the changes and configure Code Manager. Run the agent until it no longer applies corrective or intentional changes.

Deploy with Code Manager
============
1. Test the connection to the control repository:
    ```
    puppet code deploy --dry-run
    ```

2. Observe the following output:
    ```
    ...
    Found 2 environments.
    [
      {
        "environment": "production"
      },
      {
        "environment": "webapp"
      }
    ]
    ```
    The output indicates that Code Manager was able to connect to and read all the Git branches in the control repo.

3. Check the contents of the Puppet code directory. You can find the Puppet codedir with the command:
    ```
    puppet config print codedir
    ```
    Use the following command to view the contents of the **environment** directory:
    ```
    ls -lah /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/
    ```

4. Note that the directory environment `webapp` branch has not been deployed.

5. Deploy the `webapp` branch manually:
    ```
    puppet code deploy webapp --wait
    ```
6. Check the contents of the Puppet code `environments/webapp` directory:
    ```
    ls -lah /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/webapp
    ```

    üîÄ Switch to the **Windows Agent** tab.<br><br>

7. Compare these contents with the `control-repo > Puppetfile` contents in the control repository on the Windows server. Note that the directory environment `webapp` branch has been deployed and the `modules` subdirectory now contains the Apache module because the new version of the Puppetfile has instructions to deploy it from your Git server.

Configure a webhook to deploy code automatically
============
  üîÄ Switch to the **Primary Server** tab.
1. Generate and show a login token for the code deployment user:
    ```
    puppet access login deployer --lifetime 180d
    ```
2. Show the access token, and then save it to your notes:
    ```
    more /root/.puppetlabs/token
    ```
   üîÄ Switch to the **Git Server** tab.<br><br>

3. Log in with username `puppet` and password `puppetlabs`. After you log in, look for the **Repositories** sidebar on the right.  Click the link to go to the **puppet/control-repo** repository.
4. Click the **Settings** link on the upper right.
5. Click to open the **Webhooks** tab.
6. Click **Add Webhook** in the upper right, and select **Gitea** from the menu.
7. Copy the following link into the **Target URL** field:
    ```
    https://puppet:8170/code-manager/v1/webhook?type=github&token=
    ```
8. Copy the Puppet admin token that you copied earlier to the end of the link; then, click **Add Webhook** at the bottom of the page. Your final webhook config should look like:
    ```
    https://puppet:8170/code-manager/v1/webhook?type=github&token=YOURTOKENVALUEHERE
    ```

9. In the list of webhooks, click the URL for the webhook that you just added.
10. At the bottom of the page, click **Test Delivery**.  After a few seconds, you should see an entry in the list with a green checkmark next to it.


‚úÖ From now on, pushing new code to the Git server will trigger an automatic deployment of that new code to the primary server via Code Manager.

## üéà **Congratulations!**
In this lab, you created a dedicated code deployment user that you used to authenticate to deploy code. You then configured Code Manager to authenticate and download your control repo from the Git server. Next, you created a feature branch in your control repo, which enabled you to develop safely without affecting production. Then, to test a code deployment, you added a module to the Puppetfile on your feature branch. Finally, you deployed code from your feature branch to the primary server, enabling you to test changes on nodes in a separate Puppet environment.
