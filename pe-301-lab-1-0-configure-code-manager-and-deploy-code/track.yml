title: 'PE301 Lab 1.0: Configure Code Manager and Deploy Code'
teaser: Deploy code faster and with fewer errors by pushing it automatically from
  source control to the primary server.
description: |-
  ## Introduction

  Manually moving code from one place to another — from source control to the primary Puppet server — can be time-consuming and error prone.

  You can automate this workflow by creating a dedicated Code Deployment user and configuring Code Manager to automatically push code from your source control to the primary server. This automation makes code deployment faster and reduces deployment errors.

  This automation also provides an audit trail so you can tell which team or individual delivered which code. It also reduces the security footprint by limiting access to the primary server to only users that are assigned the dedicated Code Deployment role.

  In this lab, you will:
  - Create a dedicated code deployment user that you will use to authenticate to deploy code.
  - Configure Code Manager to authenticate and download your control repo from the Git server.
  - Create a feature branch in your control repo from the main branch. This enables you to develop safely without affecting production.
  - Add a module in your Puppetfile on your feature branch to test a code deployment.
  - Deploy code from your feature branch to the primary server to enable you to later test changes on nodes in a separate Puppet environment.

  ## Prerequisites

  None

  ## Technical recommendations


  For the best lab experience, use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari are not suitable for this lab — if you must use one of these browsers, see the [Lab Help Guide](https://puppet-kmo.gitbook.io/practice-lab-help/) for workarounds.

  ## Keep an eye on the clock

  ![20 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/20min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 45 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 20 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  When you're ready to begin, click **Start track**. When you've completed the lab, click **Stop** (appears at the top of this page after the lab starts).
