title: Identify Your Nodes Using External Facts
teaser: You can use facts to help you write conditional expressions and reusable code.
description: |-
  ## Introduction

  In this lab, you'll run Facter to retrieve a core fact value. Then, you'll use that value to define a simple external fact that sets site-specific information about the node.

  Facts provide a foundation on which you can write conditional expressions and reusable code. Examples include:
  * Using facts in a file template to configure different versions of a file based on the fact values that the agents send to the primary server — such as creating a web server config file for each agent, where the server hostname setting is dynamically set to the hostname fact value sent by the agent.
  * Defining facts to use in PuppetDB queries or to provide the primary server with additional information for building the agent node's catalog.

  ## Prerequisites

  None

  ## Technical recommendations

  For the best lab experience, use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari are not suitable for this lab — if you must use one of these browsers, see the [Lab Help Guide](https://puppet-kmo.gitbook.io/practice-lab-help/) for workarounds.

  ## Keep an eye on the clock

  ![20 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/20min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 30 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 20 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  When you're ready to begin, click **Start track**. When you've completed the lab, click **Stop** (appears at the top of this page after the lab starts).
