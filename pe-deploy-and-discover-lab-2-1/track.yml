      In this lab, you will:

      * Configure the primary server to enable policy-based autosigning, enabling new nodes to be automatically added and managed by the primary server.

      In this example, the policy includes a simple check for a password. More complex policies might include an external database lookup or requiring other information to be passed in with the certificate request.

      * Run the agent installation script and automatically sign the agent's certificate by providing a challenge password.

      Click **Start** when you're ready to begin.
  assignment: |
    1. On the **Primary Server** tab, navigate to:
    ```
    cd /etc/puppetlabs/puppet
    ```
    2. Create and edit the autosign.rb script:
    ```
    vim autosign.rb
    ```
    3. Copy the code below into the file.

    To do this, type `:set paste`, press **Enter**, and then press `i`. Click the code below to copy it, and paste it from the clipboard. Then, save and exit by pressing `ESC` and typing `:wq`.
    ```
    #!/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/ruby
    #
    # A note on logging:
    #   This script's stderr and stdout are only shown at the DEBUG level
    #   of the server's logs. This means you won't see the error messages
    #   in puppetserver.log by default. All you'll see is the exit code.
    #
    #   https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/ssl_autosign.html#policy-executable-api
    #
    # Exit Codes:
    #   0 - A matching challengePassword was found.
    #   1 - No challengePassword was found.
    #   2 - The wrong challengePassword was found.
    #
    require 'puppet/ssl'

    csr = Puppet::SSL::CertificateRequest.from_s(STDIN.read)
    psk = File.read('/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/psk').chomp.strip

    if pass = csr.custom_attributes.find do |attribute|
         ['challengePassword', '1.2.840.113549.1.9.7'].include? attribute['oid']
       end
    else
      puts 'No challengePassword found. Rejecting certificate request.'
      exit 1
    end

    if pass['value'] == psk
      exit 0
    else
      puts "challengePassword does not match: #{pass['value']}"
      exit 2
    end
    ```

    4. Make the script executable and set the owner/group to `pe-puppet:pe-puppet`:
    To save time, you can click the code below to copy it, and then paste it on the command line.
    ```
    chmod 700 /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/autosign.rb
    chown pe-puppet:pe-puppet /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/autosign.rb
    ```

    5. Create and edit the pre-shared key (PSK) file:
    ```
    vim psk
    ```

    6. Copy the following pre-shared key into the file.
    Type `:set paste`, press **Enter**, and then press `i`. Click the code below to copy it, and paste it from the clipboard. Then, press `ESC` and type `:wq`.

    ```
    PASSWORD_FOR_AUTOSIGNER_SCRIPT
    ```

    7. Lock down the key file permissions and set the owner/group to `pe-puppet:pe-puppet`. On the **Primary Server** tab, run:

    ```
    chmod 600 /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/psk
    chown pe-puppet:pe-puppet /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/psk
    ```

    8. Configure the primary server to enable autosigning with `autosign.rb` by running:

    ```
    puppet config set autosign /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/autosign.rb --section server
    ```

    9. Restart the primary server:

    ```
    sudo service pe-puppetserver restart
    ```

    10. On the **Linux Agent** tab, install the Puppet agent by using the installation script with the `custom_attributes:challengePassword` parameter:

    ```
    uri='https://puppet:8140/packages/current/install.bash'
    curl --insecure "$uri" | bash -s custom_attributes:challengePassword=PASSWORD_FOR_AUTOSIGNER_SCRIPT
    ```

    11. When the installation is complete, switch to the **PE Console** tab and log in with username `admin` and password `puppetlabs`.

    12. From the console sidebar, navigate to the **Nodes** page and confirm that the `nixagent` node is shown in the node list, which means that the agent's certificate was signed automatically and the node is now managed by PE.

    13. Click the `nixagent` node, and on the **Facts** tab, explore the facts about the machine, such as OS version, number of CPUs, and so on.

    Congratulations! You installed the Puppet agent with autosigning enabled.
