  ## Introduction
  The first step in creating a Bolt task is to convert a script into a format that Puppet can work with. Here, you will use a Bash script to back up the log files of an NGINX installation.

  In this lab, you will:
   - Check out NGINX code from source control.
   - Use Puppet Development Kit (PDK) to create a Bolt task.
   - Add a pre-written Bash script to the Bolt tasks folder. The Bolt task will back up the NGINX logs to a target that you specify.
   - Use a metadata JSON file to describe the parameters in the backup script.
   - Run acceptance tests against a development node.

  ## Prerequisites
  None

  ## Keep an eye on the clock

  The virtual learning environment will stay up for 60 minutes, however, this lab should only take about **30 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  When you're ready to begin, click **Start track**. When you've completed the lab, click **Stop** (shown at the top of this page after the lab starts).
