title: Convert a script into a task
teaser: Convert a Bash script into a Bolt task and encapsulate the task parameters
  by adding them to a metadata file.
notes:
- type: text
  contents: |-
    The first step in creating a Puppet task is to convert a script into a format that Puppet can work with. Here, you will use a Bash script to back up the log files of an NGINX installation.

    In this lab, you will:
     - Check out NGINX code from source control.
     - Use Puppet Development Kit (PDK) to create a task.
     - Add a pre-written Bash script to the Bolt tasks folder. The Bolt task will back up the NGINX logs to a target that you specify.
     - Use a metadata JSON file to describe the task, formalize its data types, and encapsulate the parameters passed to the script.
     - Run acceptance tests against a development node.

     Click **Start** when you're ready to begin.

Pull down NGINX code and create a Bolt task
========
1. On the **Windows Workstation** tab, from the **Start** menu, open **Visual Studio Code**.<br><br>
2. Enable VS Code autosave by clicking **File** > **Auto Save**.<br><br>
3. Open the `C:\CODE` directory. Click **File** > **Open Folder**, navigate to the `C:\CODE` directory and click **Select Folder**.<br><br>
4. In VS Code, open a terminal. Click **Terminal** > **New Terminal**.<br><br>
5. In the terminal window, run the following command to clone the NGINX module:
    ```
    git clone git@gitea:puppet/nginx.git
    ```
6. Change directories into the NGINX module:
    ```
    cd .\nginx
    ```
7. Use Puppet Development Kit (PDK) to create a Bolt task to back up the logs:
    ```
    pdk new task backup_logs
    ```
    ‚úèÔ∏è **Note:** When prompted whether you consent to PDK collecting anonymous usage information, choose whichever option you prefer. This information is not stored after the lab expires.

    ‚úÖ **Result:** You created two files needed to set up the initial Bolt task: `backup_logs.sh` and `backup_logs.json`. ![cli output that shows files added](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/files-added.png)

Edit the Bolt task and JSON file
========

1. In VS Code, open `backup_logs.sh` (**File** > **Open File...** > **CODE** > **nginx** > **tasks** > **backup_logs.sh**). Replace the contents of this backup script with the following script, which copies logs from `/var/log/nginx` to a target subdirectory under `/var/backup` using the current timestamp as the directory name:

    ```
    #!/bin/bash
    # Sites backup script
    source_dir="/var/log/nginx"
    target_dir="/var/backup"

    # Target directory using a timestamp
    day=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
    target_dir_bkp="$target_dir/$day"
    mkdir -p $target_dir_bkp

    # Back up the files
    echo "$(date) Backing up $source_dir to $target_dir_bkp"
    cp -aR $source_dir/* $target_dir_bkp
    echo "$(date) Backup finished"

    # Diff to verify (diff returns a non-zero exit code if it finds any differences
    diff --recursive $source_dir $target_dir_bkp
    ```
3. In the same directory, open the `backup_logs.json` metadata file. Replace the contents of the file with the following JSON metadata, which includes a description of the Bolt task, no-op settings, and parameters:

    ```
    {
      "description": "Backs up nginx logs",
      "supports_noop": false,
      "parameters": {}
    }
    ```
4. In the VS Code terminal, run the following PDK command to validate the new Bolt task:
    ```
    pdk validate
    ```
    ‚úèÔ∏è **Note:** It might take a minute or two for the validation to complete.<br><br>
5. Now, run your Bolt task against `nixagent1` to confirm that it works:
    ```
    bolt task run nginx::backup_logs --targets nixagent1
    ```

‚úÖ **Result:** In the command line output, notice that the task ran successfully against nixagent1: `Successful on 1 target: nixagent1`

Modify the Bolt task to accept Bolt-supplied parameters
========
1. In the VS Code window, return to `backup_logs.sh` and replace the values for `source_dir` (line 3) and `target_dir` (line 4) with Bolt-supplied parameters:
    ```
    source_dir=$PT_source_dir
    ```
    ```
    target_dir=$PT_target_dir
    ```

2. Open `backup_logs.json`. Replace the contents with the following code, which supplies default parameters for the Bolt task:
    ```
    {
      "description": "Backs up nginx logs",
      "supports_noop": false,
      "parameters": {
        "source_dir": {
          "description": "Source directory to back up.",
          "type": "String",
          "default": "/var/log/nginx"
        },
        "target_dir": {
          "description": "Target directory to save the backup to.",
          "type": "String",
          "default": "/var/backup"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
‚úÖ **Result:** The files were updated to accept new parameters.

Run the new Bolt task and push it to the Git server
========

1. Now that your Bolt task is updated, it can run successfully. In the terminal window, run the Bolt task against `nixagent2`:
    ```
    bolt task run nginx::backup_logs --targets nixagent2
    ```
    ‚úÖ **Result:** Notice the command line output which shows that the task ran successfully against nixagent2:
    `Successful on 1 target: nixagent2`<br><br>

2. Because the Bolt task run was successful, you can now commit your new Bolt task to the Git repo and push it to the Git server:
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add a task to backup logs"
    git push
    ```

    ‚úÖ **Result:** The output that follows the `git push` command indicates that the Bolt task to back up logs was pushed to the Git server: ![git push output](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/git-push-output.png)

----------

üéà **Congratulations!** You took an NGINX log backup script written in Bash and converted it into a Bolt task. You provided parameters via the command line and added defaults to the new Bolt task's JSON metadata file, encapsulating the task parameters. By doing so, you formalized the parameters and data types, making the task more secure, flexible, and easier to maintain. If you want to, you can spend some time exploring this environment.
