In this lab, you simulated a Puppet run to understand how Puppet remediates drift and keeps your systems in their desired state. You:
 - Caused drift by making a breaking change to a Puppet component (the `pxp-agent` or the uninstaller script).
 - Ran Puppet with the `--noop` parameter to simulate a Puppet run without making changes to the system.
 - Ran Puppet normally to fix the drift you caused.
