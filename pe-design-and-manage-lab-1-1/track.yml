  In this lab, you will simulate a Puppet run to understand how Puppet remediates drift and keeps your systems in their desired state. You will:


  - Cause drift by making a breaking change to a Puppet component (the `pxp-agent` or the uninstaller script).
  - Run Puppet with the `--noop` parameter to simulate a Puppet run without making changes to the system.
  - Run Puppet normally to fix the drift you caused.

  **Prerequisites**

  None

  **Keep an eye on the clock**

  ![10 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/10min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 60 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 10 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  Click **Start track** when you're ready to begin.
