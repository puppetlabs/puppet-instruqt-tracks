title: 'PE501 Lab 1.0: Configure Continuous Delivery for Puppet Enterprise (Hot Start)'
teaser: Before you can build your continuous delivery pipelines, you must configure
  integrations with Puppet Enterprise and source control.
description: |-
  ## Introduction
  In order to work and automate Puppet code tests and deployments, Continuous Delivery for Puppet Enterprise requires access to Puppet Enterprise (PE) and your source control tool, so a list of prerequisite setups is needed before designing your workflows via CI/CD pipelines.

  In this lab, you will configure the integrations you need to build your pipelines. You will:
   - Create a user and a workspace.
   - Configure integration with PE.
   - Configure integration with source control.
   - Add a job hardware node.

  ## Prerequisites
  None

  The virtual learning environment will stay up for 60 minutes, however, this lab should only take about **30 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  When you're ready to begin, click **Start track**. When you've completed the lab, click **Stop** (shown at the top of this page after the lab starts).
