title: 'PE401 Lab 3.1: Add Defined Types to a Module to Support Virtual Hosts'
teaser: Break your module class into smaller classes, and then use class inclusion
  to make the code base more maintainable.
description: |-
  ## Introduction
  You must design your module to be consumed by profiles in a customizable way. To do this, your module must not make assumptions and it must be flexible. Creating new websites with their own static content is not part of the module's responibility - this is left to the end user, to be declared at the profile layer. In this lab you will split your large module class into smaller classes, and then use class inclusion to make the code base more maintainable. You will also create some examples to be distributed with your module to demonstrate its ideal usage.

  In this lab, you will:
   - Use the `contain` function and class relationships to split the module into separate classes and manifest files.
   - Create a defined type to manage separate website instances.

  ## Prerequisites

  None

  ## Technical recommendations

  For the best lab experience, use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari are not suitable for this lab â€” if you must use one of these browsers, see the Lab Help Guide for workarounds.

  ## Keep an eye on the clock

  ![30 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/30min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 45 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 30 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  When you're ready to begin, click **Start track**. When you've completed the lab, click **Stop** (appears at the top of this page after the lab starts).
