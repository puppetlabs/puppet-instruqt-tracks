title: Introducing Data Types and Class Parameters
teaser: Use file resources in your Apache profile to manage website content.
description: |+
  This lab demonstrates using Hiera and class parameters to abstract the port value and docroot values in the apache profile.

  **What you'll learn**

  In this lab, you will:
  - Refactor the apache profile to introduce a `$port` class parameter of data type `Integer`.
  - Add a common setting for all nodes running Apache HTTP Server to use the same docroot via `common.yaml` and Hiera.
  - Deploy your code to production.


  **Prerequisites**

  [Refactor the apache web server profile](https://play.instruqt.com/puppet/tracks/pe-develop-and-maintain-lab-3-0)

  **Technical requirements**

  For the best lab experience, use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari are not suitable for this lab — if you must use one of these browsers, see the [Lab Help Guide](https://puppet-kmo.gitbook.io/practice-lab-help/) for workarounds.
