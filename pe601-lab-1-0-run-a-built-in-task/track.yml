  ## Introduction
  Puppet Enterprise (PE) ships with several pre-built tasks and plans that you can run from both the command line and the PE console.

  In this lab, you will run pre-built tasks that accomplish the following:
   - Reboot a node under enforcement.
   - Gather facts on a specific node.
   - Stop and start the time service.
   - Gather system information about the PuppetDB PostgreSQL installation.

  ## Prerequisites
  None

  ## Technical recommendations

  For the best lab experience, use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari are not suitable for this lab — if you must use one of these browsers, see the Lab Help Guide for workarounds.

  ## Keep an eye on the clock

  The virtual learning environment will stay up for 60 minutes, however, this lab should only take about **30 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  When you're ready to begin, click **Start track**. When you've completed the lab, click **Stop** (shown at the top of this page after the lab starts).
