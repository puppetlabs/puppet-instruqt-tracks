title: 'PE301 Lab 3.0: Refactor the apache Web Server Profile'
teaser: Use Hiera and class parameters to abstract the port value in the apache profile.
description: |-
  ## Introduction

  In this scenario, you'll configure nodes whose pp_datacenter fact is set to "dc-west" to serve web server applications on port 8080 instead of port 80 (which is the port specified in the organization's default apache.pp profile).

  To do this, you'll use Hiera and class parameters to externalize the port value in the apache profile. Moving data out of your profiles enables you to easily reuse them.

  In this lab, you will:

  - Run a PQL query to get the list of nodes in the dc-west data center.
  - Extend the apache profile by using a class parameter to externalize port information.
  - Test your changes by running Puppet against a specific node group.
  - Test your changes incrementally in a canary release. Within the subset of nodes in the canary release, you'll run Puppet in no-op mode and run it again normally.
  - Deploy code to the production environment.

  ## Technical recommendations

  For the best lab experience, use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari are not suitable for this lab â€” if you must use one of these browsers, see the [Lab Help Guide](https://puppet-kmo.gitbook.io/practice-lab-help/) for workarounds.

  ## Keep an eye on the clock
  ![20 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/20min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 45 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 20 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  When you're ready to begin, click **Start track**. When you've completed the lab, click **Stop** (appears at the top of this page after the lab starts).
