title: Test Changes in an Agent-Specified Node Group
teaser: Configure PE to enable environment-based testing using a one-time run exception
  environment group.
description: |
  ## Introduction

  Reduce the risk in code deployment by enabling the testing of changes in a safe environment - often referred to as *canary testing*. For example, you can assign nodes to node groups that simulate your development, staging, and production environments. As you develop features, you can test your code in any of these environments.

  You'll use both dynamic (via trusted facts) and static (manual) methods to assign nodes to node groups to build the test environments that you need.

  In this lab you will:
   - Configure PE so that you can implement environment-based testing using a one-time run exception environment group.

  ## Prerequisites

  [Configure Code Manager and Deploy Code](https://play.instruqt.com/puppet/tracks/pe-develop-and-maintain-lab-1-0)

  ## Technical recommendations

  For the best lab experience, use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari are not suitable for this lab — if you must use one of these browsers, see the [Lab Help Guide](https://puppet-kmo.gitbook.io/practice-lab-help/) for workarounds.

  ## Keep an eye on the clock

  ![20 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/20min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 45 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 20 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  When you're ready to begin, click **Start track**. When you've completed the lab, click **Stop** (appears at the top of this page after the lab starts).
