  # We're putting the finishing touches on this BETA Puppet Practice Lab — go ahead and take a peek!

  Please help us find any bugs that need to be zapped and share your feedback for improving this learning experience by clicking the **Bug Zapper** tab at the top of each challenge and completing the short survey.

  We welcome your suggestions and value your feedback. If you have additional comments or suggestions after completing this BETA Puppet Practice Lab, please [reach out to us directly](mailto:education@puppet.com).

  Suppose you have code, such as time synchronization code, that runs on both Windows and Linux. Rather than *duplicating* the code to run on different platforms, you can abstract the configuration settings into an external data source (such as .yaml files) so that you can *reuse* the code (roles, profiles, and modules) across platforms.

  By separating data from code, you're following the DRY principle, so that you … don't repeat yourself.

  How does Puppet reconcile the externalized data with the rest of your code? It uses Hiera, a built-in key-value lookup tool. When Puppet compiles node catalogs, it invokes Hiera to search for and retrieve the data it needs.

  Hiera looks up data by using the `puppet lookup` command. You can run this command from the command line when you want to explore and test your data.

  Separating data from code enables code reuse, which ensures consistency in your code base and means that you spend less time developing and maintaining code.


  **What you'll learn**

  In this lab you will:
   - Use the **`puppet lookup`** command on the primary server to discover how Hiera looks for data based on the hiera.yaml configuration and node facts.

  **Keep an eye on the clock**

  ![30 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/30min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 60 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 30 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  Click **Start track** when you're ready to begin.
