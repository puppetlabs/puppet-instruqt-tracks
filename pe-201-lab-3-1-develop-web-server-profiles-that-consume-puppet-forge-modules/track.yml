title: 'PE201 Lab 3.1: Develop Web Server Profiles that Consume Puppet Forge Modules'
teaser: Build apache and iis web server profiles with Puppet code and Puppet Forge
  modules.
description: |
  ## Introduction

  In this lab, you will create and configure a pair of web servers: a CMS backend web application server powered by Apache HTTP and a front-end ecommerce application server powered by Internet Information Services (IIS) for Windows® Server.

  To do this, you'll use the roles and profiles pattern. You'll create and build the profile classes, which consume component modules from Puppet Forge. After you build the profiles, you'll compose roles consisting of these profiles to continue building out the capability of your data center across Linux and Windows nodes.

  In this lab, you will:

  - Create `apache` and `iis` profile classes that configure web server implementations and add them to role classes.
  - Update these profiles to use the `apache` module and the `iis` module from Puppet Forge.
  - Add the profiles to existing role classes.
  - Add the `apache` and `iis` modules and their dependencies to the Puppetfile in your control repo. The Puppetfile manages module dependencies.
  - Run Puppet in no-op mode to simulate a Puppet run across all nodes without actually making changes.
  - After successful testing, run Puppet again to make sweeping changes — in this case, fast provisioning — across your data center.

  ## Prerequisites

  None

  ## Technical recommendations

  For the best lab experience, use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari are not suitable for this lab — if you must use one of these browsers, see the [Lab Help Guide](https://puppet-kmo.gitbook.io/practice-lab-help/) for workarounds.

  ## Keep an eye on the clock

  ![20 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/20min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 45 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 20 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  When you're ready to begin, click **Start track**. When you've completed the lab, click **Stop** (appears at the top of this page after the lab starts).
