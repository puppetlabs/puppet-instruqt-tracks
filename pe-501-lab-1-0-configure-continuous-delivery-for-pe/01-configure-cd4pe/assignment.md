teaser: Before you can build your continuous delivery pipelines, you must configure
  integrations with Puppet Enterprise and source control.
notes:
- type: text
  contents: |-
    In this lab, you will configure the Continuous Delivery for PE integrations you need to build your pipelines. You will:

     - Create a user and a workspace.
     - Configure integration with PE.
     - Configure integration with source control:
        - Integrate PE.
        - Integrate source control.
        - Add a job hardware node.

     Click **Start** when you're ready to begin.

Create a Continuous Delivery user and user role in PE
========
You'll use this user and role to generate the PE authentication token required during the setup process and to view a centralized log of the activities Continuous Delivery for PE completes on your behalf.

### Create a Continuous Delivery user
1. Log into the console with username `admin` and password `puppetlabs`.<br><br>
1. Navigate to **Admin** > **Access Control**.<br><br>
1. In the **Full name** field, enter `CD4PE User`.<br><br>
1. In the **Login** field, enter `cd4pe_user`, and then click **Add local user**.<br><br>
1. Click the new `CD4PE User` link in the list below.<br><br>
1. In the top right corner, click **Generate password reset**.<br><br>
1. Copy the password reset link into a new browser tab.<br><br>
1. Enter the password `puppetlabs` in the new password box and click **Reset password**.<br><br>
1. Close the tab, close the password reset box, and return to the PE console.<br><br>

### Set the user's role and permissions
1. Under the **User roles** tab, click **Manage roles**.<br><br>
1. In the **Name** field, enter `CD4PE`. In the **Description** field, enter `CD4PE role`, and then click **Add role**.<br><br>
1. Click the new `CD4PE` link in the list of roles below.<br><br>
1. From the **User name** list, select `CD4PE User`, click **Add user**, and then click **Commit 1 change**.<br><br>
1. Click the **Permissions** tab and add the following required permissions to the role (after selecting the options, click **Add** to set each permission):

    - **Job orchestrator:** Start, stop and view jobs.
    - **Node groups:** Create, edit, and delete child groups, All.
    - **Node groups:** Edit configuration data, All.
    - **Node groups:** Set environment, All.
    - **Node groups:** View, All.
    - **Nodes:** View node data from PuppetDB.
    - **Puppet agent:** Run Puppet on agent nodes.
    - **Puppet environment:** Deploy code, All.
    - **Puppet Server:** Compile catalogs for remote nodes.
    - **Tasks:** Run tasks, `cd4pe_jobs::run_cd4pe_job`.<br><br>
16. Click **Commit 10 changes** at the bottom right.

    âœ… **Result:** The system creates the CD4PE user and role.

Configure Code Manager in PE
========
You must enable and configure Code Manager to enable Continuous Delivery for PE to initiate code deployments as part of a pipeline job run.

1. On the **PE Server** tab, create an SSH key:
    ```
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "root@puppet" -f /etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ssh/id_ed25519 -q -P ""
    ```

    ðŸ”€  Switch to the Windows workstation tab<br><br>

2. On the desktop, double-click the **Gitlab** browser shortcut.<br><br>
3. For username, enter `puppet`. For password, enter `puppetlabs`.
    - If prompted to save the password, choose either option.<br><br>
4. In the top right corner, click the circular icon dropdown, and then click **Preferences**. ![drop-down button](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/drop-down-icon.png)

5. In the icon menu at the left, click the upper key icon (for SSH keys). ![key icon](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/key-top.png)

6. Copy the contents of the `id_ed25519.pub` file generated in the first step into the **Key** text area.
    - To find the contents, return to the PE Server tab and run the following:
        ```
        cat /etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ssh/id_ed25519.pub
        ```
    - Note the generated title, and select an expiration date in the future. Click **Add key**.<br><br>
7. Navigate to **Menu** > **Projects** > **Your projects**, and then click **puppet/control-repo**. ![menu projects with outlines](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/menu-projects-your-projects-amber.png)
8. Click the **Clone** dropdown, and then click the copy icon to the right of **Clone with SSH**. ![clone dropdown menu](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/git-clone-amber-2.png)
    ðŸ”€ Switch to the PE Console tab<br><br>

9. Navigate to **Node groups**.<br><br>
9. Click the plus (**+**) icon to the left of **PE Infrastructure** to expand the group, and then click **PE Master**.<br><br>
9. Click the **Classes** tab and scroll to the bottom to find the **puppet_enterprise::profile::master** class.<br><br>
10. For this class, set the following (click **Add to node group** to set each parameter):
    - **code_manager_auto_configure**: `true`
    - **r10k_remote**: Paste the SSH clone URL you copied in step 8.
    - **r10k_private_key**: `/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ssh/id_ed25519`  <br><br>

11. Click **Commit 3 changes**.

    ðŸ”€ Switch to the **PE Server** tab<br><br>
