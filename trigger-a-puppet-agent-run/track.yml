title: Run Puppet Manually After Defining a Desired State
teaser: Learn the basics of defining a node's desired state, and watch how the agent
  makes changes to achieve desired state during a Puppet run.
description: |-
  ## Introduction

  By default, Puppet runs every 30 minutes. But you can manually run Puppet, too - for example, when you simply want to observe what happens during a Puppet run or if you're developing code and want to observe the agent as it makes the required changes to the agent node.

  The Puppet agent is an application that manages configurations on your nodes by using a [*catalog*](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/glossary.html#catalog). After requesting and receiving the catalog from the primary Puppet server, the agent checks the current state of each [*resource*](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/glossary.html#resource) that the catalog describes, making changes as needed to get each resource into its desired state.

  In this track, you'll walk through what happens on the agent node during a Puppet run to understand how the agent communicates with the primary server.

  You'll learn how to:
  - List and sign agent certificates, required for secure communication between the primary server and agent.
  - Interpret the agent output during the Puppet run.
  - Write code in the server's site.pp manifest to classify a node and begin defining its desired state.

  ## Prerequisites
  None

  ## Technical recommendations

  For the best lab experience, use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari are not suitable for this lab — if you must use one of these browsers, see the [Lab Help Guide](https://puppet-kmo.gitbook.io/practice-lab-help/) for workarounds.

  ## Keep an eye on the clock

  ![20 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/20min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 30 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 20 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  When you're ready to begin, click **Start track**. When you've completed the lab, click **Stop** (appears at the top of this page after the lab starts).
