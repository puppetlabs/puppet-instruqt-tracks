In this lab, you learned how the primary server and agent communicate during a Puppet run.

You learned how to:
1. List and sign agent certificates.
1. Manually trigger a Puppet run and interpret the output.
1. Write code in the server's `site.pp` manifest to classify a node and specify its desired state.
