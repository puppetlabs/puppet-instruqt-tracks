In this lab, you learned how the primary server and agent communicate during a Puppet run.

You learned how to:
1. List and sign agent certificates.
1. Manually trigger a Puppet run and interpret the output.
1. Write code in the server's `site.pp` manifest to classify a node and specify its desired state.

To try these steps out in your own environment, visit the companion [Job Aid](https://puppet-kmo.gitbook.io/lab-aids/-MZKPjwKRKKFuXxxy7ge/).

To learn more about certificate autosigning, take the [PE101 Lab 2.1: Configure Agent Certificate Autosigning](https://play.instruqt.com/puppet/invite/o0auiwrwy7v0) lab or read the [Puppet documenation for autosigning certificate requests](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/6/ssl_autosign.html).
