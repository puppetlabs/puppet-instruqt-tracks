title: 'PE101 Lab 3.2: Establish Server Roles by Reinstalling Agents with Trusted
  Facts'
teaser: Purge the agent from your nodes and reinstall it with Puppet's trusted facts.
description: |-
  ## Introduction

  In this lab, you'll purge the Puppet agent from your nodes, and then reinstall the agent on each node to include Puppet's pp_role and pp_datacenter trusted facts.

  Because trusted facts are extracted from the agent certificate, the data is immutable, providing a higher level of security for your nodes. You can use the data from facts to *classify* — or, group — nodes so that you can get configuration and performance data for a specific group of nodes.

  ## Prerequisites

  This lab builds on concepts introduced in other Puppet Enterprise 101 Deploy & Discover labs. You might find it helpful to complete these labs first:
   - [Identify Your Nodes Using External Facts](https://play.instruqt.com/puppet/invite/7njh4szvazdy)
   - [Identify Server Roles by Using Package Data Collection](https://play.instruqt.com/puppet/invite/qbye99iuacew)

  ## Technical recommendations

  For the best lab experience, use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari are not suitable for this lab — if you must use one of these browsers, see the [Lab Help Guide](https://puppet-kmo.gitbook.io/practice-lab-help/) for workarounds.

  ## Keep an eye on the clock

  ![20 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/20min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 30 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 20 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  When you're ready to begin, click **Start track**. When you've completed the lab, click **Stop** (appears at the top of this page after the lab starts).
