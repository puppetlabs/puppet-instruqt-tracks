teaser: Learn how to request, locate, and inspect the Puppet agent catalog.
description: |-
  ## Introduction

  In this lab, you will:
  * Explore the Puppet run lifecycle by kicking off a Puppet run.
  * Inspect an agent catalog — built during a Puppet run — to see what the Puppet agent manages out of the box.

  ## Prerequisites

  None

  ## Technical recommendations


  For the best lab experience, use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari are not suitable for this lab — if you must use one of these browsers, see the [Lab Help Guide](https://puppet-kmo.gitbook.io/practice-lab-help/) for workarounds.

  ## Keep an eye on the clock

  ![10 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/10min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 35 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 10 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  When you're ready to begin, click **Start track**. When you've completed the lab, click **Stop** (appears at the top of this page after the lab starts).
