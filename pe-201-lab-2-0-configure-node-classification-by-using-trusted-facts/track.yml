title: 'PE201 Lab 2.0: Configure Node Classification by Using Trusted Facts'
teaser: Use Facter and trusted facts to dynamically classify the roles of the nodes
  in your infrastructure.
description: |
  ## Introduction

  Configuring nodes by assigning classes, parameters, and variables to them is called *classification*. Dynamically classifying nodes — instead of hardcoding information in your Puppet manifests — makes it easy to add and remove nodes from your infrastructure, reducing manual inventory management and strengthening your code base.

  In this lab, you will:

   - Modify the `site.pp` file in your control repo to assign role classes to nodes (or *classify* them) by using trusted facts.
   - Create placeholder code to build out initial ecommerce, web application, and load balancer roles.
   - Run Puppet to test your changes.

  ## Prerequisites

  None

  ## Technical recommendations

  For the best lab experience, use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari are not suitable for this lab — if you must use one of these browsers, see the [Lab Help Guide](https://puppet-kmo.gitbook.io/practice-lab-help/) for workarounds.

  ## Keep an eye on the clock

  ![20 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/20min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 45 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 20 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  When you're ready to begin, click **Start track**. When you've completed the lab, click **Stop** (appears at the top of this page after the lab starts).
