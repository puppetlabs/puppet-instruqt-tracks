title: 'PE201 Lab 1.1: Simulate Changes by Running in No-op Mode'
teaser: Simulate a Puppet run to understand how Puppet remediates drift and keeps
  your systems in their desired state.
description: |-
  ## Introduction

  In this lab, you will simulate a Puppet run by running Puppet in no-op ("no operation" or "do nothing") mode to understand how Puppet remediates drift and keeps your systems in their desired state.

  Running Puppet in no-op mode is useful for reviewing your changes so that you can push your Puppet code and data to production in a safe, controlled, and manageable way.

  You will:

  - Cause drift by making a breaking change to a Puppet component (the `pxp-agent` or the uninstaller script).
  - Run Puppet with the `--noop` parameter to simulate a Puppet run without making changes to the system.
  - Run Puppet normally to fix the drift you caused.

  ## Prerequisites

  None

  ## Technical recommendations

  For the best lab experience, use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari are not suitable for this lab — if you must use one of these browsers, see the [Lab Help Guide](https://puppet-kmo.gitbook.io/practice-lab-help/) for workarounds.

  ## Keep an eye on the clock

  ![10 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/10min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 35 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 10 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  When you're ready to begin, click **Start track**. When you've completed the lab, click **Stop** (appears at the top of this page after the lab starts).
