title: 'PE101 Lab 2.0: Install Puppet Agents'
teaser: Learn how to install agents from both the command line and the Puppet Enterprise
  console.
description: |-
  ## Introduction

  In this lab, you'll install the Puppet agent via two different methods: locally by using the agent installation script and remotely from the Puppet Enterprise (PE) console. Both methods enable you to install agents at scale.

  Installing agents at scale prepares your infrastructure to quickly and automatically scale up the number of nodes managed and configured as Puppet manifests are written and deployed to the primary Puppet server.

  ## Prerequisites

  None

  ## Technical recommendations

  For the best lab experience, use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari are not suitable for this lab â€” if you must use one of these browsers, see the [Lab Help Guide](https://puppet-kmo.gitbook.io/practice-lab-help/) for workarounds.

  ## Keep an eye on the clock

  ![15 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/15min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 30 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 15 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  When you're ready to begin, click **Start track**. When you've completed the lab, click **Stop** (appears at the top of this page after the lab starts).
