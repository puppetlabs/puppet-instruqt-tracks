title: Identify Server Roles by Using Package Data Collection
teaser: Use the package data that you collect to identify the roles of the servers
  in your environment.
description: |-
  **What you'll learn**

  In this lab, you'll learn how to enable the package data collection feature via the PE console to discover which packages are installed across your systems. Then, you will use this information to identify the roles of the servers in your environment (web server, database server, and so on).

  When you know which packages are installed on your systems:
  - You can identify which nodes are impacted by packages you know are eligible for maintenance updates, security patches, and license renewals.
  - You can define a **role** fact to group nodes and collect configuration and performance data about a specific node group.

  **Prerequisites**

  This lab builds on concepts introduced in other PE Deploy and Discover labs. You might find it helpful to complete:

  **Keep an eye on the clock**

  ![30 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/30min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 60 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 30 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.
