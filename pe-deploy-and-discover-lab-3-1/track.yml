title: Identify Server Roles by Using Package Data Collection
teaser: Use the package data that you collect to identify the roles of the servers
  in your environment.
description: |-
  ## Introduction

  In this lab, you'll learn how to enable the package data collection feature via the PE console to discover which packages are installed across your systems. Then, you will use this information to identify the roles of the servers in your environment (web server, database server, and so on).

  When you know which packages are installed on your systems:
  - You can identify which nodes are impacted by packages you know are eligible for maintenance updates, security patches, and license renewals.
  - You can define a **role** fact to group nodes and collect configuration and performance data about a specific node group.

  ## Prerequisites

  This lab builds on concepts introduced in other PE Deploy and Discover labs. You might find it helpful to complete:

  ## Technical recommendations

  For the best lab experience, use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari are not suitable for this lab — if you must use one of these browsers, see the [Lab Help Guide](https://puppet-kmo.gitbook.io/practice-lab-help/) for workarounds.

  ## Keep an eye on the clock
  ![20 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/20min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 30 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 20 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  When you're ready to begin, click **Start track**. When you've completed the lab, click **Stop** (appears at the top of this page after the lab starts).
