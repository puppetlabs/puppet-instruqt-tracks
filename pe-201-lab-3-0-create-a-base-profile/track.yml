title: 'PE201 Lab 3.0: Create a Base Profile'
teaser: Create a base profile that shows a dynamic login message based on information
  retrieved from trusted facts.
description: |+
  ## Introduction

  Your systems likely complete tasks that are common across all nodes, such as showing a login message, enabling network time synchronization, or setting up (or removing) access via ssh or remote desktop.

  You can include these common configuration tasks in a *base profile*, which you can then include in all of your roles (web server, ecommerce server, and so on) to ensure that all systems, regardless of their role, have the same base configuration. As your business and technology needs change, you can easily update the base profile by including only the technology-specific profiles and classes that you need.

  Creating a base profile — a basic but important building block — means faster and consistent provisioning, less maintenance, and a sustainable code base.

  In this lab, you will:
  - Add a base profile to existing roles. You'll discover that Puppet cannot build a catalog until you create the classes that you include in your `.pp` files.
  - Use Puppet Development Kit (PDK) to create a base profile class.
  - Add a class to the base profile to show a dynamic, role-specific login message based on information retrieved from trusted facts.
  - Log into nodes that have different roles to see the dynamic login message.

  ## Prerequisites

  None

  ## Technical recommendations

  For the best lab experience, use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari are not suitable for this lab — if you must use one of these browsers, see the [Lab Help Guide](https://puppet-kmo.gitbook.io/practice-lab-help/) for workarounds.

  ## Keep an eye on the clock

  ![20 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/20min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 45 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 20 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  When you're ready to begin, click **Start track**. When you've completed the lab, click **Stop** (appears at the top of this page after the lab starts).
