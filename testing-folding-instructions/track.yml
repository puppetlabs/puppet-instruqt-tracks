  Manually moving code from one place to another — from source control to the primary Puppet server — can be a time-consuming and error-prone process.

  You can automate this workflow by creating a dedicated Code Deployment user and configuring Code Manager to automatically push code from your source control to the primary server.

  This automation makes code deployment faster and reduces deployment errors. It also provides an audit trail — you can tell which team or individual delivered which code — and reduces the security footprint limiting access to the primary server to only users that are assigned the dedicated Code Deployment role.


  **What you'll learn**

  In this lab, you will:
  - Create a dedicated code deployment user that you will use to authenticate to deploy code.
  - Configure Code Manager to authenticate and download your control repo from the Git server.
  - Create a feature branch in your control repo from the main branch. This enables you to develop safely without affecting production.
  - Add a module in your Puppetfile on your feature branch to test a code deployment.
  - Deploy code from your feature branch to the primary server to enable you to later test changes on nodes in a separate Puppet environment.

  **Prerequisites**

  **Keep an eye on the clock**

  ![30 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/30min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 60 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 30 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  Click **Start track** when you're ready to begin.
