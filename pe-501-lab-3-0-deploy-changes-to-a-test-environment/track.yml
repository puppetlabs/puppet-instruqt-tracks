title: 'PE501 Lab 3.0: Deploy Changes to a Test Environment'
teaser: Deploy changes to a test environment
description: |-
  ## Introduction
  In this lab, you will:
   - Add a deployment step to a pipeline and ensure deployments to nodes (including test nodes) use a best-practice approach.
   - Add a trigger based on a merge request from the main branch of the control repo.

  Completing these steps will result in a workflow that deploys changes to test nodes after pull requests to the main branch from a feature branch are successful.

  ## Prerequisites
  None

  ## Technical recommendations

  For the best lab experience, use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari are not suitable for this lab â€” if you must use one of these browsers, see the Lab Help Guide for workarounds.

  The virtual learning environment will stay up for 60 minutes, however, this lab should only take about **30 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  When you're ready to begin, click **Start track**. When you've completed the lab, click **Stop** (appears at the top of this page after the lab starts).
