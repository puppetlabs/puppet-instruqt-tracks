title: 'PE501 Lab 3.0: Deploy Changes to a Test Environment'
teaser: Deploy changes to a test environment
description: |-
  ## Introduction
  In this lab you will:
   - Add a deployment step to a pipeline and ensure deployments to nodes (including test nodes) use a best practice approach.
   - Add a trigger based on a merge request from the main branch of the control repo.

  Completing these steps will result in a workflow that deploys changes to test nodes after pull requests to the main branch from a feature branch are successful.

  ## Prerequisites
  None

  ## Technical recommendations

  ## Keep an eye on the clock

  The virtual learning environment will stay up for 60 minutes, however, this lab should only take about **30 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  When you're ready to begin, click **Start track**. When you've completed the lab, click **Stop** (appears at the top of this page after the lab starts).
