title: Install and Explore the Puppet Agent on Linux
teaser: Install the Puppet agent on a fresh node and explore some of the tools that
  it provides.
description: |-
  In this track, you’ll use the command-line tools installed with the Puppet agent to interact with a node in the same way an agent would.

  **Why complete this track?**

  This hands-on approach will help you understand the agent's role in the broader Puppet architecture and how the agent checks and modifies the state of a node it’s installed on.

  **Keep an eye on the clock**
