description: |+
  ## Introduction

  This lab demonstrates using Hiera and class parameters to abstract the port value and docroot values in the apache profile.

  In this lab, you will:
  - Refactor the apache profile to introduce a `$port` class parameter of data type `Integer`.
  - Add a common setting for all nodes running Apache HTTP Server to use the same docroot via `common.yaml` and Hiera.
  - Deploy your code to production.

  ## Prerequisites

  [Refactor the apache web server profile](https://play.instruqt.com/puppet/tracks/pe-develop-and-maintain-lab-3-0)

  ## Technical recommendations

  For the best lab experience, use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari are not suitable for this lab â€” if you must use one of these browsers, see the [Lab Help Guide](https://puppet-kmo.gitbook.io/practice-lab-help/) for workarounds.

  ## Keep an eye on the clock

  ![20 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/20min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 45 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 20 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  When you're ready to begin, click **Start track**. When you've completed the lab, click **Stop** (appears at the top of this page after the lab starts).
