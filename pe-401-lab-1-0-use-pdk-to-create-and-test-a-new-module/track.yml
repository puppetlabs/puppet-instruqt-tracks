title: 'PE401 Lab 1.0: Use PDK to Create and Test a New Module'
teaser: Use PDK to create, test, and validate a new module and a new class.
description: |-
  ## Introduction

  In this lab scenario, the app team at your company has just developed a web server service (software) called **NGINX**, which has been deployed manually to several test nodes. Now you must create a module to configure and manage it across your company's fleet.

  In this lab, you will:

  - Explore the current state of your test nodes and produce Puppet code that will help you to develop your module.

  - Create, test, and validate a new module and a new class by using **Puppet Development Kit (PDK)**. With PDK, you save time by not having to write any boilerplate code.

  - Use the Puppet code that you obtained to manage the resources for the NGINX package and service. Then, use PDK to validate the code's syntax and style before running a unit test to ensure your code compiles and functions as expected.

  ## Prerequisites
  None

  ## Technical recommendations

  For the best lab experience, use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari are not suitable for this lab â€” if you must use one of these browsers, see the Lab Help Guide for workarounds.

  ## Keep an eye on the clock

  The virtual learning environment will stay up for 30 minutes, however, this lab should only take about **20 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  When you're ready to begin, click **Start track**. When you've completed the lab, click **Stop** (appears at the top of this page after the lab starts).
